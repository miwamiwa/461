setup:

1. install node-js

2. get the json file with your google cloud service account's credentials,
with google cloud speech activated on that service account's project.

3. create a file called .env in this directory (nodeapp) and add the 4 lines
below. Be sure to add in the info from your own google service account json file
in the last three lines. This file won't be pushed to github, since the gitignore
is set to avoid .env files.
